# java-snake-game
A simple version of Snake, built in Java.
Based on Bro Code's video tutorial, found here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI6e6qjJ8JQ

## Extra additions

- food flashes random colours
- food will not appear where snake's body already is

## Ideas for future implementation

- put in a special piece of food randomly that is worth more but adds extra difficulty 
  (e.g. obstacles, extra pieces of food, increase in speed or length etc.)
- if the snake hits a border, allow the snake to appear on the opposite border. 
  (Best for game scenarios where you include obstacles.)
- keep track of high scores outside of the program running
- different game modes (e.g. eating food adds a random amount of length to the snake, or
  accelerates the snake!)
